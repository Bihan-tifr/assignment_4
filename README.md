# assignment_4
Python and c codes to deal with random numbers. 
For problem 4, the c code is p4.c which calls histogram.py for plotting. 
The first part of problem 7 is done using libreoffice, since for this particular problem it was faster and easier. The latter 
part is done in usual way, using scipy.
